# My Portfolio

While I do not have much experience yet with coding, I look forward to expanding this portfolio as I continue to learn.

Currently the portfolio is not as filled out as I'd like, but that will come with time.

## Purpose

My goal with this Portfolio is to highlight things I have learned not just with links to projects but with the portfolio itself.

## Features


I have implemented Media Queries and Flex Boxes for better website responsiveness with various devices.

There is Article, Section, Footer, Nav, Header elements in place of any Div elements.

For all images I have assigned alt attributes.
